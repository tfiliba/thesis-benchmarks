Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 3,642 out of  14,720   24%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       11,758
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         2,004 out of  11,758   17%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,918 out of  11,758   16%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       7,836 out of  11,758   66%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             109 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
