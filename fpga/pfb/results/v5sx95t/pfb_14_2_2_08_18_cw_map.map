    Number used as Memory:                     130 out of  24,320    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:           130
        Number using O6 output only:           130
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:        12

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   199 out of  14,720    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          669
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            20 out of     669    2%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 232 out of     669   34%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         417 out of     669   62%
    Number of unique control sets:               8
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               5 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              32
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,152 out of   8,784   13%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
