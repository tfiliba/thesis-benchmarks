ERROR:Pack:2310 - Too many comps of type "RAMB36_EXP" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the
   Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for your design
   exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices
   reported may not be reflected accurately as their packing might not have been
   completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                 2,924 out of  58,880    4%
    Number used as Flip Flops:               2,924
  Number of Slice LUTs:                      2,408 out of  58,880    4%
    Number used as logic:                    2,182 out of  58,880    3%
      Number using O6 output only:           1,650
      Number using O5 output only:             416
      Number using O5 and O6:                  116
    Number used as Memory:                     190 out of  24,320    1%
      Number used as Shift Register:           190
        Number using O6 output only:           190
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:        36
  Number of route-thrus:                       452
    Number using O6 output only:               452

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,708
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           784 out of   3,708   21%
    Number with an unused LUT:               1,300 out of   3,708   35%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,624 out of   3,708   43%
    Number of unique control sets:              38
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             102 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       203 out of     640   31%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BlockRAM/FIFO:                     352 out of     244  144% (OVERMAPPED)
    Number using BlockRAM only:                352
    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:             324
      Number of 18k BlockRAM used:              28
    Total Memory used (KB):                 12,168 out of   8,784  138% (OVERMAPPED)
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1
  Number of DSP48Es:                            76 out of     640   11%
